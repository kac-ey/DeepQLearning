# CS370

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

I was given the setup code that created the maze and built the neural network model. I created the code for the deep-Q learning algorithm that trains the neural network to find the optimal path.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists use technology to solve problems efficiently.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

A computer scientist approaches problem solving by developing an algorithm, or a list of steps, to achieve the end result.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

One of the most important issues facing the world of computer science is bias, intentional or unintentional. This can lead not only to legal issues concerning discrimination, but can also result in a subpar product that does not effectively address the concerns of the user and/or the organization. Taking steps to avoid bias, like using resources to ensure multiple points of view are considered, is not only recommended, but should be expected.
